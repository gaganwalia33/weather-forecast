Weather Forecast Repository
The Weather Forecast repository is a complete web application designed to deliver accurate and real-time weather updates for users around the world. It integrates with reliable third-party weather APIs to fetch live data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and weather conditions (e.g., cloudy, sunny, rainy).

Key Features
Real-Time Weather Data: Displays current weather information based on the user's search or current location.

Hourly Forecast: Provides detailed weather updates hour-by-hour for better short-term planning.

7-Day Forecast: Shows an extended weather prediction for the upcoming week.

Search Functionality: Allows users to search for weather data by city name or geographical coordinates.

Location Access: Optionally detects the user's location automatically for quick forecasts.

Responsive Design: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

Modern UI/UX: Clean, intuitive, and visually appealing user interface with smooth animations and transitions.

Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (or React, Vue, etc. â€” depending on what you used)

API Integration: OpenWeatherMap API / WeatherAPI / any other weather service

State Management: (if applicable) React Context API / Redux / Vuex

Other Tools: Axios for API calls, TailwindCSS or Bootstrap for styling (if used)

How It Works
The application sends a request to the weather API when a user inputs a location or when the app accesses the device's location.

The API responds with real-time weather data.

The frontend processes and displays this information in an organized, easy-to-read layout.

Users can view current, hourly, and 7-day forecasts, along with additional details like sunrise/sunset times, UV index, and more (depending on the API features used).
